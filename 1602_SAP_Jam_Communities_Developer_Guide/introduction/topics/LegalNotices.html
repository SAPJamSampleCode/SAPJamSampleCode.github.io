        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Coding Samples</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Any software coding and/or code lines / strings ("Code") included in this
                documentation are only examples and are not intended to be used in a productive
                system environment. The Code is only intended to better explain and visualize the
                syntax and phrasing rules of certain coding. SAP does not warrant the correctness
                and completeness of the Code given herein, and SAP shall not be liable for errors or
                damages caused by the usage of the Code, unless damages were caused by SAP
                intentionally or by SAP's gross negligence.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accessibility</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The information contained in the SAP documentation represents SAP's current view of
                accessibility criteria as of the date of publication; it is in no way intended to be
                a binding guideline on how to ensure accessibility of software products. SAP in
                particular disclaims any liability in relation to this document. This disclaimer,
                however, does not apply in cases of wilful misconduct or gross negligence of SAP.
                Furthermore, this document does not result in any direct or indirect contractual
                obligations of SAP.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Gender-Neutral Language</h2>
            
            <p class="p">As far as possible, SAP documentation is gender neutral. Depending on the context,
                the reader is addressed directly with "you", or a gender-neutral noun (such as
                "sales person" or "working days") is used. If when referring to members of both
                sexes, however, the third-person singular cannot be avoided or a gender-neutral noun
                does not exist, SAP reserves the right to use the masculine form of the noun and
                pronoun. This is to ensure that the documentation remains comprehensible.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Internet Hyperlinks</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The SAP documentation may contain hyperlinks to the Internet. These hyperlinks are
                intended to serve as a hint about where to find related information. SAP does not
                warrant the availability and correctness of this related information or the ability
                of this information to serve a particular purpose. SAP shall not be liable for any
                damages caused by the use of related information unless damages have been caused by
                SAP's gross negligence or willful misconduct. All links are categorized for
                transparency (see: <a class="xref" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer" target="_blank">http://help.sap.com/disclaimer</a>).</p>
