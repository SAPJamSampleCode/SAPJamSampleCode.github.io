    <h1 class="title topictitle1">The <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> UI Widget
        Library</h1>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p"><span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> offers a JavaScript
            library which makes it possible to easily embed a number of different widgets that can
            display your organization's <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> content and functionality in a variety of different contexts or
            experiences. This document provides instructions on how to:</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Include the <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> UI
                widgets library in a web page.</li>

            <li class="li">Specify the widget or view that you want to display.</li>

            <li class="li">Specify the product that you want the widget to display information about.</li>

        </ul>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assumptions</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This document assumes you have access to an instance of <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span>, and that this
                instance has been properly integrated and synchronized with another system, or
                systems, that serve as the source or master for your product catalog information.
                Currently, this integration has only been verified with SAP hybris Commerce. While
                integrations with other e-commerce applications, and even other types of web
                application, are theoretically possible, they have not been tested and will not be
                supported by SAP without prior approval. For further information on this topic,
                please refer to the <a class="xref" href="http://help.sap.com/businessobject/product_guides/Jam14/en/SAP_Jam_Communities_for_hybris_Administration_Guide.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span>
                    Administration Guide</a>.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Prerequisites</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In order to successfully embed an <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> UI widget in a web page you will need to be able to access the
                    <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> Widget
                Library. There are 2 way of enabling this:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">You can download the <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> UI widget library to your organization's local system and set
                    the statements required to include it in your organization's web pages. This
                    approach is not recommended as it breaks SAP's ability to perform ongoing
                    feature updates, as well as any required issue fixes or security improvements.
                    As a result, SAP will not support or provide assistance in using this
                    option.</li>

                <li class="li">You can include the <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> UI widget library from SAP's cloud-based content distribution
                    location. This is the recommended approach for all <span class="ph">SAP Jam Communities</span> UI widget
                    library integrations.</li>

            </ul>
