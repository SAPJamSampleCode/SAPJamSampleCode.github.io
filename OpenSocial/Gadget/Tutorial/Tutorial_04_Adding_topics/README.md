Lesson 4 - Adding topics
=========================

This fourth lesson of the tutorial expands on the initial JavaScript code by demonstrating the use of some of the gadget.json functions to store an array of strings, and it will demonstrate the use of some of the Apache wave functions to ensure that changes made by others to this array of JSON strings are updated in real time to keep the list of options that we are encoding current for all users.
